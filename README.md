Aws DevOps Practice
This task has been given to me by Ashok, to whom I met last Thrusday. I expressed him my curiosity to learn DevOps and to start my creer into IT Industry. Promptly he was ready to help me and guide me providing weekly task and this is my first week task that I am working on it. I really appreciate his help and to my concerns its very rare that you find such people in life who is ready all the time to help others. I am greatly thankful to Ashok!!
